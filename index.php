        <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0">TrunkSide is Orlando's first curbside app!</h4>
        <br> I worked as the Lead Designer responsible for strategizing the UX/UI design for the first front-end demo of TrunkSide during Knight Hacks, University of Central Florida's 36 Hour Hackathon. <br><br> I designed prototypes for three screens using Figma. This Hackathon was the first time I had used Figma on a large scale project. I also pair programmed with two of my teammates as an observer, allowing me to use my knowledge of React and CSS to learn the basics of Flutter and lead the UI/UX strategy.<br><br>
        I will continue working with TrunkSide as Lead Designer as it grows into an MVP to serve local customers and restaurants.

      <p class="date">October 2020</p>
      <div class="desc"> I created a website for a ficiticious bakery, inspired by my love for baked goods. It was built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and SASS. I used PHP and SASS to create efficient pages with custom styles. <br><br>
        I've started working on a feature built with PHP and Javascript that will allow users to create an account, log in, and place an order. <br><br>

      <p class="date">July 2020.</p>
      <p class="desc">This is a concept mock-up for the University of Central Florida's Historical Buildings Tour. My design concept centered on making the university archives page a more user-friendly experience for researchers <i>and</i> casual visitors alike, while following UCF's brand standards for the web.<br><br> The mock-up includes eight pages, a home page, a building page, and six pages for each of the building's archived photographs. <br><br> All eight pages were built with HTML, CSS, and UCF's front-end framework based on Bootstrap called 'Athena'. I created seven prototypes with Adobe XD to plan out the layout for mobile, medium, and large screen sizes to plan out a responsive and cohesive design between pages.<br><br></p>
