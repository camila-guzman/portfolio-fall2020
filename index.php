          Now you can create an account by visiting 'Place Order', log in, place an item in your cart, delete your account, and finally log out.
          <br><br>

          I used MySQL to organize a database with two tables: one for account information with encrypted passwords and a second table for menu items.<br><br>

          I'm currently working on improving this update so it is in my development branch! I will continue working on implementing a fully functioning shopping cart with PHP and MySQL

      <h2>Event Feature for WordPress</h2>
      <div class="project-1-grid">
        <p class="date">December 2020</p>
        <div class="desc"> I designed and built a feature for the Office of Student Involvement (OSI) WordPress Theme! Previously, the web team had to manually enter each event using HTML and CSS on the Event page every week. Now, there will be a section to add new events and the theme will automatically display events in a responsive grid layout and order the events by date and time.<br><br>

          I found that this task always took up more time than anticipated at the start of each week so I'm excited for it to become a built-in feature for the OSI WordPress theme. The feature will be live in 2021!

          <br> I worked as the Lead Designer responsible for strategizing the UX/UI design for the first front-end demo of TrunkSide during Knight Hacks, University of Central Florida's 36 Hour Hackathon. <br><br> I designed prototypes for three screens using Figma. This Hackathon was the first time I had used Figma on a large scale project. I also pair programmed with two of my teammates as an observer, allowing me to use my knowledge of React and CSS to learn the basics of Flutter and lead the UI/UX strategy.<br><br>
          I will continue working with TrunkSide as Lead Designer as it grows into an MVP to serve local customers and restaurants.

        <p class="desc">This is a concept mock-up for the University of Central Florida's Historical Buildings Tour. My design concept centered on making the university archives page a more user-friendly experience for researchers <i>and</i> casual visitors alike, while following UCF's brand standards for the web.<br><br> The mock-up includes eight pages, a home page, a building page, and six pages for each of the building's archived photographs. <br><br> All eight pages were built with HTML, CSS, and UCF's front-end framework based on Bootstrap called 'Athena'. I created seven prototypes with Adobe XD to plan out the layout for mobile, medium, and large screen sizes to plan out a responsive and cohesive design between pages.<br><br></p>
